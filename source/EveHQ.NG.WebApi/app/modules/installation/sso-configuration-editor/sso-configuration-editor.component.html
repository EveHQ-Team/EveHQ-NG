		<summary>What is application authentication and authorization</summary>
		<p>
			To access developers API of EVE Online the application should authenticate itself trough EVE Online Single Sign On API (SSO).
			For this purprose the application should be registered on EVE Online developers site. During authentication and authorization
			process used a pair of unique strings: the Client ID and the Client secret. After authorization the web-browser should redirect
			session key to the application using so called Custom URL-schema which should be registered in the operation system.
			All three of these strings comes from the developers site after a new application registration. The first two are autogenerated,
			the last one is chosen by the application owner. Here you can choose to use the default application SSO configuration or
			use your own.
		</p>
		<h3>Pros and cons</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				With the default configuration you shouldn't do any additional actions. With own configuration you should register yourself
				as a developer and create a new application.
			</li>
			<li>
				Some day CCP can ban the application for some reason and you will required to create your own anyway. Your own application is
				your own application.
			</li>
			<li>
				Potentially it's more secure to have your own application. The Client ID and the Client secret of the default configuration
				is not a secret at all, it's impossible to keep it in secret for any application hosted on users' devices or has open sources.
			</li>
			<li>
				An application could be authorized to access only some parts of EVE Online developers API. There is a notion of scopes that
				represent these parts. The default configuration will not require access to all scopes, only to required I know about. You
				can change the application and add new functionality or use some third-party plug-in. In this case you should be able to
				modify the list of scopes required by the application. You can do it only on the developers' site and you can do it only
				for your own application.
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			So my suggestion is to use the default configuration only for eveluation purprose and switch to your own SSO application
			configuration after you decide that you are happy with it. You can change this SSO configuration later any time.
