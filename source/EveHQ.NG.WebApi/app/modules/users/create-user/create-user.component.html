			Most of the EVE players have no need for a few different meta-game profiles. You need more than one if you, for example,
			if you manage a corporation as a CEO, lead fleets as fleet commander and play as a single player sometimes.
			Profile is more about list of characters playing together.

			Most of the players need just one.
